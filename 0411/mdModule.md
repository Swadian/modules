* Each section (class) should have a **Los Rios** Canvas shell. As per [the current LRCFT contract](https://www.lrcft.org/what-we-do/contract/), section 11.2.5, "All faculty who teach classes shall have the following level of minimum usage of the mutually approved Learning Management System (LMS) for all classes irrespective of modality, except in instances where the use of an LMS is prohibited." The contract further specifies that:
   1.  Include instructor contact information and office hours when applicable.
   2.  Post the course syllabus.
   3.  Publish the LMS course shell no later than the first day of instruction for online courses, and by the end of the first week of classes for on-ground courses. For last minute course assignments, appropriate adjustments and accommodations will be made.
   4.  Require students to visit their LMS course.
   5.  Use the LMS gradebook consistent with the grading procedure outlined in the faculty member’s syllabus, ensuring compliance with 8.4.1.8. The LMS gradebook may be customized to reflect the faculty member’s approach to grading, such as contract grading, ungrading, or equity for grading, for example.
* The syllabus of each class should be submitted to the division office before the first class meeting.
