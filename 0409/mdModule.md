Module 0409: Defining a "session"
=================================

The definition of a "session" is important because the word is referenced in the [Los Rios Regulation R-2222](https://losrios.edu/shared/doc/board/regulations/R-2222.pdf). Ultimately, how this term is defined dictates the interpretation of attendance or the lack there of.

The word "session" is defined as "a meeting of a deliberative or judicial body to conduct its business." In this context, the body is a class, and the business is instruction and other educational activities. The confusing part has to do with the term "meeting." In a synchronous or in-person class, meetings (lecture or lab) are physical and well defined by a time and a location. A person is either present or absent.

What about online classes that are 100% asynchronous without any schedule time of meeting?

# Session implies a time frame

Even for asynchronous online classes, there are activities that have specific time frames. Specifically, there are due dates where certain activities must be completed. These deadlines or due dates can serve as a substitute of a session. Technically, these due dates serve exactly as the end of a session. What remains flexible is how each student allocate time to work during a session.

# Reasonable time frame

Each class has a start date indicated in the schedule. Legally, students should not be expected to have to spend time to do any class related work prior to this date. Let us assume this technical start date is on a Saturday (this is usually the case for classes that start at the beginning of a semester).

When the first session ends (and hence the work is due) depends on the complexity of the activity. For example, a light activity may involve the student filing a form to indicate various information with only some of the fields mandatory. For such lighter activities, a due date of the end of the following Monday allows 3 days for a student to respond.

# A suggested time table at the beginning of the semester

|Day | What happens |
|----|--------------|
|0   |Send students the first email/notification. Release the first activity that is due at the end of day 3. |
