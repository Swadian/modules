# _Module 0416: Computer Information Science (CIS) as a prospect career choice_

# Why should I consider CIS?

## Personal Strength and Interest Alignment

There is no gentle to put this: you have to like and good at what you do. This goes  against the current trend of ["Do what lets you have the life you want."](https://www.themuse.com/advice/maybe-you-shouldnt-do-what-you-love). But why?

Other career fields may not be the same. CIS is, at the same time, highly competitive and has high growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports a [25% growth](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) over 10 years. However, there is also a [7.8% unemployment among recent graduates](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Unemployment.Final_.update1.pdf).

Most career options related to CIS (also called ICT, Information and Communication Technology) involve problem-solving, *quickly* learning new concepts, critical thinking, and analysis. These are *in addition* to being able to communicate effectively. A natural follow-up question is: can these abilities be learned via higher education? A fair answer is "to a certain degree."

The Employment Development Department of California (EDD) has [a tool](https://labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/LMID/Self_Assessment_for_Career_Exploration.html) to assess the interests and strengths of an individual for the purpose of career exploration. This is an *excellent* starting point to explore or to validate a particular career choice. No tool is 100% accurate, it is also best to talk to a counselor, a professor, or a practitioner to gain more depth of understanding.

## Time-frame

High-salary jobs in ICT often require a bachelor's degree in computer science (B.Sc. in CS). The current trend is that a master's degree is increasingly helpful for career advancement. 

So what good is a community college?

A community college, such as American River College, offers degrees that transfer to a four-year university. *Typically*, a student acquires an Associate of Science (AS) degree in about two years, then transfers to a four-year university as a junior.
