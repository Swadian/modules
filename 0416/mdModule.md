# _Module 0416: Computer Information Science (CIS) as a prospect career choice_

# Why should I consider CIS?

## Personal Strength and Interest Alignment

There is no gentle to put this: you have to like and good at what you do. This goes  against the current trend of ["Do what lets you have the life you want."](https://www.themuse.com/advice/maybe-you-shouldnt-do-what-you-love). But why?

Other career fields may not be the same. CIS is, at the same time, highly competitive and has high growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports a [25% growth](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) over 10 years. However, there is also a [7.8% unemployment among recent graduates](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Unemployment.Final_.update1.pdf).

Most career options related to CIS (also called ICT, Information and Communication Technology) involve problem-solving, *quickly* learning new concepts, critical thinking, and analysis. These are *in addition* to being able to communicate effectively. A natural follow-up question is: can these abilities be learned via higher education? A fair answer is "to a certain degree."

The Employment Development Department of California (EDD) has [a tool](https://labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/LMID/Self_Assessment_for_Career_Exploration.html) to assess the interests and strengths of an individual for the purpose of career exploration. This is an *excellent* starting point to explore or to validate a particular career choice. No tool is 100% accurate, it is also best to talk to a counselor, a professor, or a practitioner to gain more depth of understanding.

## Time-frame

High-salary jobs in ICT often require a bachelor's degree in computer science (B.Sc. in CS). The current trend is that a master's degree is increasingly helpful for career advancement. 

So what good is a community college?

A community college, such as American River College, offers degrees that transfer to a four-year university. *Typically*, a student acquires an Associate of Science (AS) degree in about two years, then transfers to a four-year university as a junior.

American River College also offers certificates of achievement. A certificate of achievement typically requires a lower number of units, and it can be attained in two semesters or so. Most certificates of achievement relate to industry certifications or specific job skills. As such, certificates of achievement can be instrumental to starting a career without getting a B.Sc.

That being said, in the long run, a B.Sc. in computer science is recommended for potential career growth.

# Entry level jobs

According to the [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm), computer support specialists (IT support) have the lowest entry into the ICT industry. While enjoying a "faster than average" job outlook, growing by 5% over 10 years, the median salary is about $60,000/yr.

Most other career paths have entry-level positions, but the level of competition can vary. [Many career paths](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Top-8-most-in-demand-IT-tech-jobs) prefer job experience *as a starting point*. Most B.Sc. in computer science graduates start their careers as software developers or software engineers. This is both because of the general nature of the work as well as the high early-career median salary. However, software engineering and software development are also some of the *most competitive* job markets, often with technical assessments in the interview process that are more difficult than final exams of classes!

Transitioning from an entry-level job to advance along a career path can be challenging. Large employers, such as the State of California, make career advancement easier due to the vast amount of opportunities within the same organization.

# How to get started at American River College?

Register, then with a student ID, [explore careers](https://arc.losrios.edu/admissions/pathwayu-career-exploration) using the pathwayU tool. Then, take the result and talk to people in the college:

* Counselors. A counselor can help with many aspects of college education.
* Department chairs. A department chair has an in-depth understanding of the subject, the programs, and the careers.
* HomeBase success coach. A HomeBase success coach is an encyclopedia of resources available on campus or online.

For people who are not sure about which career path to pursue, it is best to take the first class of a program and evaluate the alignment with interests and aptitude. The following is an example:

|career path|class to take|
|-----------|-------------|
|software engineering|CISC 310 and CISP 300|
|network technician|CISN 340|
|IT support|CISC 361|
|Cybersecurity technician|CISS 315|

These are some recommendations. Some courses have "advisory" suggestions. For individuals who are unsure, it is best to take advisory courses first.
