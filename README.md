# modules

This is a `GitHub` repository that hosts Prof. Tak's instructional content. The majority of the content is located at [his site](http://dtkb.org/~auyeunt/teaches/modules). However, some newer content is being developed here. Some older content is being converted into GitHub Markdown format.

The [directory](directory.md) is automatically regenerated whenever there is an update to the module files. For the [GitHub workflow to work](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows), the heading of a module should follow this template:

```markdown
# _Module 1234: title_
```

Also, for the GitHub workflow to work, [the GitHub bot should have read/write permissions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-push).
