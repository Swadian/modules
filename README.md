# modules
This is a `GitHub` repository that hosts instructional content of Prof. Tak. The majority of the content is located at [his own site](http://dtkb.org/~auyeunt/teaches/modules). However, some newer content is being developed here. Some older content is being converted into GitHub Markdown format.

The [directory](directory.md) is automatically regenerated whenever there is an update to the module files. The heading of a module should follow this template:

```markdown
# _Module 1234: title_
```

Also, in order for the GitHub workflow to work, [the GitHub bot should have read/write permissions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-push).
