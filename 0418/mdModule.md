# _Module 0418: A Student's Guide to Gen-AI_

# What is...

Before the actual discussion, let us first explore the meaning of some terms that will be used.

## Gen-AI?

Gen-AI (generative artificial intelligence) refers to technologies that generate content based on simple prompts. The content can be text, images, video, music, etc.

## Academic Integrity

There are varying definitions of academic integrity. All the definitions share a common theme: the outcome of an assessment authentically reflects the ability and competence of the individual (human) being assessed.

## Aptitude

In this context, an aptitude is:

* Innate (natural).
* An ability.

## Interest (Inclination)

An interest is a "want" or "desire" to learn or to do something. 

# How Gen-AI is used

Gen-AI can be considered a person who can help with studying, homework, etc. There are two distinct ways to use Gen-AI:

* To generate a significant portion of a submission.
* To be used *in the process* of developing a submission.

A litmus test is to ask the following question:

> In the absence of the Gen-AI technology, will the outcome of the submission differ significantly relative to the rubric of the assessment?

The rubric is essentially in this litmus test because if Gen-AI does not affect the outcome based on the rubric, then the use of Gen-AI technology also does not affect the assessment outcome. For example, if "Grammatical correctness" is not a part of the rubric, then the use of Grammarly (but strictly for grammar correction) is probably not impacting the outcome of an assessment.

## Academic Dishonesting (cheating) or not?

> In the absence of the Gen-AI technology used in a submission, and a student is allowed to reattempt and resubmit an equivalent assessment, does the assessment outcome of resubmission change based on the published rubric?
