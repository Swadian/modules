## Computer science as a case study

* In-demand: [employment growth of 23% from 2022 to 2032, considered a high growth.](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm)
* High recent graduate unemployment: [7.8%](https://www.synergisticit.com/tech-companies-not-hire-computer-science-graduates/)
* Why? (Hint: read the article linked in the previous point.)
* Will G-AI improve the situation or make it worse?

## Big question

* Are the SLOs applicable to G-AI or our students?
