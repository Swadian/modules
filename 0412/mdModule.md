# _Module 0412: Student-centric generative AI_

---

## What is generative AI?

* Artificial Intelligence tool that generates content:
  * Text
  * Images
  * Videos
  * Music

---

## AI may be a misnomer

* **Not** artificial:
  * Most AI tools are neural-net-based.
    * Machine learning from observing numerous human-created content
    * Humans also filter and select samples for training
    * A lot of human thumbs in this pie!
* **Not** intelligent:
  * Knowledgeable? Yes.
  * Intelligent? Not yet.
  * Limited critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
  * Very limited creative thinking and theorizing abilities.

## Examples

* ChatGPT
* Claude
* Gemini

---

## Student-centric objectives

* Get employed.
* Learn skills.
* Gain knowledge.
* Qualify for advancement.
* Transfer.

---

## Common ineffective ways of using G-AI

* Use AI in assessments intended to assess the students.
* "If AI can do your homework and take your tests, AI **will** take your job!"

## Computer science as a case study

* In-demand: [employment growth of 23% from 2022 to 2032, considered a high growth.](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm)
* High recent graduate unemployment: [7.8%](https://www.synergisticit.com/tech-companies-not-hire-computer-science-graduates/)
* Why? (Hint: read the article linked in the previous point.)
* Will G-AI improve the situation or make it worse?

---

## Big question

* Are the SLOs applicable to G-AI or our students?
* If a student meets the SLOs but only with G-AI tools, is this student successful?
* *How* do we define student success?

---

## Learning versus assessment

* Use G-AI in the learning phase, not the assessment phase.

---

## G-AI explanation

* G-AI can help explain many concepts, but can it be relied upon?
  * If there is plenty of human-generated content that is correct, then the G-AI answer is more likely to be correct.
  * Does not work as well for concepts that do not have plenty of human-generated explanations.
* Can a student validate the G-AI explanation?
* Neural-net-based G-AI are probabilistic, there is *always* a chance of error.

---

## G-AI Q&A

* G-AI can generate questions for faculty and students.
* Is the answer (key) correct?
* Can a student validate the G-AI answer?

---

## A responsible way to use G-AI

* Instructor originates G-AI Q&A.
* Instructor validates and hides the answer.
* Students work on the question.
* Instructor discloses the answer and potentially evaluates the answers from each student.

---

## Practically no way to stop students from using G-AI

* Especially for fully online (and asynchronous) classes.
* Instructors need to point out and explain self-defeating ways of using G-AI.
