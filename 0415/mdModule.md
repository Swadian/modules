# _Module 0415: Projector and Screens in STEM Classrooms_

# Normal operation

## Screen operation

Most classrooms have two screens. The position of the screen matches the location of the buttons on the control screen.

## Video input

Most classrooms have two HDMI inputs. "Wall plate 1" should be connected to the workstation desktop computer. "Wall plate 2" is available to connect to a notebook computer. In the control screen, each projector can be in one of these three states:

* Off
* Connected to wall plate 1 (workstation desktop computer)
* Connected to wall plate 2 (HDMI cable on the workstation)

Note that the projectors do not automatically turn off. At the end of a class, please remember to power off the projectors.

## Audio

Most classrooms have amplifiers suitable for presentations. The amplifier can be connected to the audio of a HDMI connection.

# Trouble shooting

* Hard reset: there is no easy way to reboot the control panel and the A/V switch. It is safe open the cabinet housing the A/V equipment, and cycle power using the power strip. There are occasions when the A/V switch stops working and requires power cycling.
* If the video connection is changed after booting into Windows, Windows may not recognize the change and reconnects to one or two of the projectors. After reconfiguring the video connection, it is best to log out and log back into Windows.
* The HDMI cable to wall plate connection can be physically loose. If the video is flaky or not working, check the physical connection of the cable-wallplate connections.
